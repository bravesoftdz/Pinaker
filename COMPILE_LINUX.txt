=============== Quick Info about "How To Compile" =============================
To compile:
* make
To clean:
* make clean
To install:
* make install

What you probably want:
make && make install

Dependencies:
Lazarus (at least 0.9.28.2) + FPC (at least 2.2.4, included with Lazarus) [1]
The Ararat Synapse source code [2], Debian package available at [3]

NOTE: The Ararat Synapse source code is expected to be at /usr/lib/synapse/,
which is where the Debian package installs it.


============== More Info ======================================================

This software is written in Pascal, with some non-standard extentions. 

It is known to compile with Lazarus[1], and not to compile using GNU Pascal[4].

= Lazarus =
This software is known to successfully compile using Lazarus[1]. It was tested
with version 0.9.28.2.

== Using the GUI ==
The easier way to do so it by using the Lazarus[1] Graphical User Inferface. 
To do so, please open with it the pinaker.lpi file, and press F9.

You need to have the Ararat Synapse source code at usr/lib/synapse/
either manually or by installing the Debian package [3]. Also, to run, you 
need to place in /usr/share/pinaker all the files in websource and the file 
htmlcodes.txt.

== Using the command line ==
If you want to compile it without using a GUI, you can do it this way:
$ LAZARUS_VER=`ls /usr/lib/lazarus/|head -1`; fpc -MObjFPC -Scgi -O1 -gl -WG \
-vewnhi -l -Fi/tmp/ -Fu/usr/lib/synapse/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/lcl/units/i386-linux/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/lcl/units/i386-linux/gtk2/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/packager/units/i386-linux/ -Fu. -FU/tmp/ \
-opinaker -dLCL -dLCLgtk2 pinaker.lpr

= GNU Pascal =
We are aware that, at least at this moment, it isn't compilable using GNU
Pascal[2], since we use some things that don't belong to Pascal (ISO 7185) nor
Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) standards. 

= Debian =
To build a Debian package for pinaker, just:
$ dpkg-buildpackage
Remember: Pinaker will only build on Squeeze or above (because of its build
dependencies).
