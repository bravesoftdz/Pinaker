Quickstart:

0- You need an access key to ISBNdb (http://isbndb.com/). If
   you don't have one, create a free account with ISBNdb to
   obtain an access key.

1- Fotograph your book barcodes. The images should have 
   around 3M pixels (2048x1536), with the barcode centered
   and occupying one third of the width.

2- Copy the .jpg files to a folder, copy the folder path
   to the image folder text box.

3- Click the "Process images" button to list the ISBN numbers.

4- Click the manual fix button to correct mistakes.

5- To retreive book data from ISBNdb, copy your access key to
   the acces key text box and press the retreive button. Note
   that access to ISBNdb recors is limited by the server.
