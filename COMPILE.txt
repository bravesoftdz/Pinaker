This software is known to successfully compile using Lazarus[1]. 
To do so, please open with it the pinaker.lpi file, and press F9. 

We are aware that, at least at this moment, it isn't compilable using GNU
Pascal[2], since we use some things that don't belong to Pascal (ISO 7185) nor
Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) standards.
