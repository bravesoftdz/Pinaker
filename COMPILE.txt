=============== Quick Info about "How To Compile" =============================
To compile:
* make
To clean:
* make clean
To install:
* make install

What you probably want:
make && make install

Dependencies:
If you have Lazarus on your system, you probably have everything to build this.

============== More Info ======================================================

This software is written in Pascal, with some non-standard extentions. 

It is known to compile with Lazarus[1], and not to compile using GNU Pascal[2].

= Lazarus =
This software is known to successfully compile using Lazarus[1]. It was tested
with version 0.9.28.2.

== Using the GUI ==
The easier way to do so it by using the Lazarus[1] Graphical User Inferface. 
To do so, please open with it the pinaker.lpi file, and press F9. 

== Using the command line ==
If you want to compile it without using a GUI, you can do it this way:
$ LAZARUS_VER=`ls /usr/lib/lazarus/|head -1`; fpc -MObjFPC -Scgi -O1 -gl -WG \
-vewnhi -l -Fi/tmp/ -Fu./synapse/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/lcl/units/i386-linux/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/lcl/units/i386-linux/gtk2/ \
-Fu/usr/lib/lazarus/$LAZARUS_VER/packager/units/i386-linux/ -Fu. -FU/tmp/ \
-opinaker -dLCL -dLCLgtk2 pinaker.lpr

= GNU Pascal =
We are aware that, at least at this moment, it isn't compilable using GNU
Pascal[2], since we use some things that don't belong to Pascal (ISO 7185) nor
Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) standards.
